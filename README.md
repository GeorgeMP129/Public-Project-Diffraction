# Public-Project-Diffraction
The abandoned passion project of an unassuming baku

Note about project: All music, sound effects and paid assets (most notably the water shader) has been removed from this public repository to prevent use without permission and avoid licensing issues. 
Feel free to use all of the sprites, though. The baku wishes you the best in your creative endeavors.
